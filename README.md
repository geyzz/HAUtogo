# üìç HAUtogo: Real-Time Faculty Tracking and Class Management

**HAUtogo** is a mobile application developed for the Holy Angel University (HAU) community, focusing on real-time location tracking for professors and personalized schedule management for both students and faculty. Built with Flutter, it utilizes Supabase for secure backend services.

## üåü Project Overview

HAUtogo aims to improve campus efficiency by solving two core issues: locating faculty and providing easy access to class timetables. The application intelligently uses **Geofencing** and **Role-Based Logic** to deliver highly relevant and accurate information to every user.

## ‚ú® Main Features

### 1. Real-Time Professor Location Tracking
- **Automatic Broadcasting:** Professors' locations are automatically updated to the database when they are within the defined HAU campus geofence.
- **Student Finder:** Students can search for and view the live location marker of any professor currently on campus.
- **Fix Highlight:** Location updates are robust, resolving initial database errors by correctly mapping the `current_building` and `current_room` columns.

### 2. Role-Based Schedule Management
- **Personalized Timetables:** A dedicated Schedule Page displays a clean, weekly view of classes.
- **Data Differentiation:**
    - **Students:** View their scheduled classes by querying the `students_schedules` table.
    - **Professors:** View their teaching assignments by querying the `schedules` table.

### 3. Navigation and Utility Aids
- **Next Class Info:** Home screen panel displays the time and location of the user's next scheduled class.
- **Professor Navigator:** Professors gain access to a **'Navigate Next Room'** button which instantly centers the map on their next class assignment's location.

### 4. Authentication Suite
- Secure **Login/Logout** functionality.
- Robust **Forgot Password** utility utilizing Supabase email authentication for recovery.
- **Change Password** feature available from the Profile Page.
